  /** Post new and modified services to API.
   *
   * WARNING: This function makes a lot of brittle assumptions about many other
   * parts of the code. Please be very careful when modifying anything.
   *
   * This function is much more complex than one may realize because it needs to
   * handle many different scenarios, each of which has unique ways of sourcing
   * data from different sources.
   *
   * In the specific scenario where new addresses were created on the
   * organization _and_ these addresses were added to the service, we must POST
   * the addresses to the API _first_ before we can obtain their IDs, since they
   * do not have IDs until the backend saves them to the database. Only after
   * the addresses are created can we associate services with them.
   *
   * This needs to be handled correctly in the scenario where we must also
   * create a new service, since neither the service nor the addresses will have
   * IDs until we create them, so we cannot associate the two until we have
   * both.
   *
   * A graphical illustration of the dependency of promises follows:
   *
   * [created addresses] --->
   *                          [service-address relationships]
   * [create services] ----->
   *
   * This code attempts to handle the following scenarios:
   *
   * 1. No services have been touched. In this scenario, we just return
   *    immediately.
   *
   *    [created addresses]
   *
   * 2. Services are edited, but no changes were made to the addresses
   *    associated with the services. In this scenario, we have no chains, but
   *    we ignore the address promises and we push the service promises to
   *    the promises array.
   *
   *    [created addresses] (ignored)
   *
   *    [edit services] (pushed)
   *
   * 3. Services are edited, and they depend on newly-created addresses. In this
   *    scenario, we have a true dependency chain, and we must resolve the
   *    address promises first, retrieve their IDs, and then construct a new
   *    promise to associate the services with the addresses.
   *
   *    [created addresses] -> [associate services with addresses]
   *
   * 4. New services are created, and they depend on newly-created addresses. In
   *    this scenario, we have a chain three items deep, where we must create
   *    the addresses, create the services, and then associate the services with
   *    the addresses. Note that we could have chained them the other way
   *    around, but chaining them this way allows us to handle this in a similar
   *    way to the case where new services are created but do not depend on
   *    newly created addresses.
   *
   *    [created addresses] -> [create services] -> [associate services with addresses]
   *
   * HACK: WE CANNOT ACTUALLY IMPLEMENT SCENARIOS 3 AND 4 BECAUSE THE API DOES
   * NOT RESPOND WITH THE NEWLY CREATED ADDRESSES' IDS.
